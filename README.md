# Gittens

Disguises unpleasant gits (as in: [a completely ignorant, childish person with no manners](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Git)) that sometimes crop up on GitHub by replacing them with KITTENS!

## Installation

This should be on the Chrome Web Store soon™, but for now, go to Chrome Settings &larr; Extensions &larr; check off "Developer Mode" &larr; "Load unpacked extension...", and point it at the `dist` directory.

## Building

For development, just run `npm start`. To do a single build, run `npm run build`, if you want to do a single build without running Uglify over the code run `npm run build-dev`.
