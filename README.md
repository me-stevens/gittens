# Gittens

Disguises unpleasant gits (as in: [a completely ignorant, childish person with no manners](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Git)) that sometimes crop up on GitHub by replacing them with KITTENS!

## Installation

This should be on the Chrome Web Store soon™, but for now, go to Chrome Settings -> extensions -> load unpacked extension, and point it at the dist directory.

## Building

For development, just run `npm start`. To do a single build, run `npm run build`
